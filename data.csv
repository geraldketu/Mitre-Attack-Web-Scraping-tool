Azure offers a couple of enterprise policy settings in the Azure Management Portal that may help: ""Users -> User settings -> App registrations: Users can register applications"" can be set to ""no"" to prevent users from registering new applications. ""Enterprise applications -> User settings -> Enterprise applications: Users can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf"" can be set to ""no"" to prevent users from consenting to allow third-party multi-tenant applications"

A Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) can be used to set usage policies and manage user permissions on cloud applications to prevent access to application access tokens. In Kubernetes applications, set ""automountServiceAccountToken: false"" in the YAML specification of pods that do not require access to service account tokens. [12]"
M1017,User Training,"Users need to be trained to not authorize third-party applications they don’t recognize. The user should pay particular attention to the redirect URL: if the URL is a misspelled or convoluted sequence of words related to an expected service or SaaS application, the website is likely trying to spoof a legitimate service. Users should also be cautious about the permissions they are granting to apps. For example, offline access and access to read emails should excite higher suspicions because adversaries can utilize SaaS APIs to discover credentials and other sensitive communications."

M1015,Active Directory Configuration,"Clean up SID-History attributes after legitimate account migration is complete. Consider applying SID Filtering to interforest trusts, such as forest trusts and external trusts, to exclude SID-History from requests to access domain resources. SID Filtering ensures that any authentication requests over a trust only contain SIDs of security principals from the trusted domain (i.e preventing the trusted domain from claiming a user has membership in groups outside of the domain). SID Filtering of forest trusts is enabled by default, but may have been disabled in some cases to allow a child domain to transitively access forest trusts. SID Filtering of external trusts is automatically enabled on all created external trusts using Server 2003 or later domain controllers.  [7]   [8]  However note that SID Filtering is not automatically applied to legacy trusts or may have been deliberately disabled to allow inter-domain access to resources. SID Filtering can be applied by:  [9] Disabling SIDHistory on forest trusts using the netdom tool ( netdom trust /domain: /EnableSIDHistory:no  on the domain controller) Applying SID Filter Quarantining to external trusts using the netdom tool ( netdom trust   /domain:  /quarantine:yes  on the domain controller) Applying SID Filtering to domain trusts within a single forest is not recommended as it is an unsupported configuration and can cause breaking changes.  [9]   [6]  If a domain within a forest is untrustworthy then it should not be a member of the forest. In this situation it is necessary to first split the trusted and untrusted domains into separate forests where SID Filtering can be applied to an interforest trust"
